    <h2 class="subheader">About Me</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Jimuel. I'm a young and emerging professional based in the city of Everett. Right after high
      school in the end of 2017, I followed all the advice that were given to me which landed me to attending full time
      college for pre-nursing. While attending college, I worked full time as a Sales Representative in Xfinity
      assisting thousands of customers create entertainment plans that suits their way of living for 2 years.</p>

    <p>From my experience working in a fast paced environment and attending school, I was able to learn my strength and
      weaknesses. I started experimenting and trying different ventures which gave me experience first hand of how the
      real world works. A job shadow I went to changed my whole perspective on the decisions I made. For the first time,
      I learned to pursue a path for myself and have the courage to go against the grain. I learned to turn left when
      everyone is going right. I invested in myself and learned the fundamentals of social media marketing, network
      marketing, investing, e-commerce (drop shipping, Amazon FBA) and attended a variety of classes from businesses and
      other intro classes available.</p>

    <p>When I saw what coding is a couple months ago, I believe that I found the door to a world that I can enjoy and
      find a place where my values align. Currently, I'm enrolled in the Year Up Program to learn more about technology
      and attain a job in the tech field. I work diligently to pave new opportunities for myself and my family and to
      lead by example. Recently, I've been active on social networks seeking new connections with fellow software
      developers and future employers to broaden my professional network. I'm very thrilled to see what this new path
      brings to my professional career.</p>
